				<h3><b><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></b></h3>
				<p>
					Sachin Tendulkar is a retired Indian international cricketer and one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the sport. He was born on April 24, 1973, in Mumbai, India. Tendulkar is often referred to as the "Little Master" or the "Master Blaster."
				</p>
				<h3><b><u>EARLY LIFE AND FAMILY BACKGROUND:</u></b></h3>
				<p>
					Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 to a Maharastrian family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry. Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child. His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League. Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new children in his school. As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. He particularly idolised American player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands and carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.
				</p>
				<h3><b><u>INFO:</u></b></h3>
				<p>
					Sachin Tendulkar's cricketing career is adorned with an array of records that showcase his prowess with the bat. He holds the record for the most runs in both Test and One Day International (ODI) cricket, amassing an astonishing 15,921 runs in Tests and 18,426 runs in ODIs. His 100 international centuries, a feat unparalleled in the history of the game, solidified his status as a cricketing demigod.
					One of the few accolades that eluded Tendulkar throughout his illustrious career was a Cricket World Cup victory. The wait finally ended in 2011 when India lifted the coveted trophy, and Tendulkar played a pivotal role in the team's success. His performances in the tournament showcased not only his enduring skill but also his ability to rise to the occasion on the grandest stage.
